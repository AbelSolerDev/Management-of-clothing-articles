## 🕸️ Project Description

It is a web application that allows users to update the information of the products currently in stock in a store. Among the main functionalities are:

• A superadmin user can allow or disallow the addition, editing, or deletion of products, as well as view all users of the application.
• A series of authorized users who can access the product stock and, if allowed by the superadmin, add, edit, or delete products.


## 🚀 Technologies

For its programming, PHP, HTML, and CSS have been used, as well as a MySQL database. It has been developed following the Model-View-Controller structure, so all the code is separated based on its objectives.
All the necessary files for executing the functions implemented in this application are attached.

## ✨ Goals

Main objective: To develop a system that allows the management of a store's products and the permissions to do so.
Specific objectives:

• Develop access for different types of users to the system.
• Develop a system so that the superadmin can access the list of users and change permissions for the products.
• Develop the product management system (add, edit, and delete) and its consultation.
